# Sunya

**Sunya** is a comprehensive smart contract security analysis platform that goes beyond static analysis to protect projects from production vulnerabilities. Our solution provides meta transaction enabled security analysis, deployment, and verification for Starknet with Ethereum bridge essentials, powered by rich datasets from Tokenflow, Herodotus, and Nethermind.

## üîç Project Overview

In the blockchain ecosystem, security vulnerabilities can lead to catastrophic losses. Sunya addresses this critical need by providing an intelligent analyzer that not only detects static vulnerabilities in Starknet Contracts but continuously improves with more datasets. Our platform is designed for seamless integration into development workflows, making security analysis accessible and efficient.

## üõ°Ô∏è Key Features

### Smart Contract Analysis

- **Intelligent Vulnerability Detection**: Trained model that identifies security vulnerabilities in Starknet contracts
- **Automatic Configuration Detection**: Automatically identifies whether your project is configured for Starknet or EVM-compatible chains
- **Resource Optimization**: Automatically assigns analyzing tasks to available core memory and clears temporary storage when done
- **Plug-and-Play Functionality**: Automatically installs required tools, eliminating version and package errors

### Comprehensive Dashboard

Our dashboard integrates data from multiple sources:

- **Voyager**: Blockchain data from Starknet
- **Etherscan**: Blockchain data from Ethereum
- **Herodotus**: Storage proof for registered audits across multiple chains
- **Tokenflow**: Simplified querying of transactions and events

### Gas Tank ‚õΩ Meta Transactions

"Habits don't happen if it was hard to do!" Our Gas Tank feature enables meta transactions for seamless blockchain interactions:

- **User-Friendly dApp Experience**: Users interact with a secure, seamless, and transparent interface
- **ArgentX & Dynamic Wallet Integration**: Powered by multi-signature transaction capabilities
- **Reduced Friction**: Regular users can write to the blockchain without managing gas fees

## üíª Technical Implementation

Sunya combines multiple technologies to deliver a comprehensive security solution:

### Contract Analysis Engine

- **Starknet Tooling**: Built on Scarb project for contract building and deployment
- **Custom Analysis Model**: Trained to detect vulnerabilities, leveraging Caracal datasets
- **EVM Compatibility**: Uses Slither for static analysis of known vulnerabilities in EVM contracts
- **Multi-Chain Support**: Analyzes contracts across Starknet and Ethereum ecosystems

### Frontend Interface

- **Modern Stack**: Built with Vite.js and React for a responsive user experience
- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Options to download reports as PDF
- **Audit Registry**: Mint audits to the Audit Registry for transparency and ownership proof
- **IPFS Integration**: Each audit report is stored on IPFS using Lighthouse during audit minting

### Blockchain Integration

- **Event Monitoring**: Tokenflow and Herodotus listen to events triggered in L1 & L2 chains
- **Wallet Integration**: ArgentX enables users to interact with dApps without installing extensions
- **Multi-Signature Support**: Dynamic wallet integration for multi-signature transactions
- **Local Testing**: Nethermind's React extension for local testing of Audit Registry Contract

## üîß How It Works

1. **Project Upload**: Developers upload their smart contract project for analysis
2. **Automatic Analysis**: Sunya detects the project type and runs appropriate analysis tools
3. **Vulnerability Detection**: Our trained model identifies potential security issues
4. **Report Generation**: Comprehensive security report with detailed findings
5. **Audit Registration**: Option to mint the audit to the Audit Registry for transparency
6. **Continuous Monitoring**: Integration with blockchain data providers for ongoing security

## üìä Analysis Capabilities

Our analyzer detects various vulnerability types:

- **Reentrancy Issues**: Identifying potential reentrancy attacks
- **Integer Overflow/Underflow**: Detecting numeric boundary problems
- **Access Control Vulnerabilities**: Finding improper permission implementations
- **Logic Errors**: Identifying flawed business logic
- **Gas Optimization**: Suggesting improvements for gas efficiency
- **Starknet-Specific Issues**: Addressing vulnerabilities unique to the Starknet ecosystem

## üèÜ Recognition

Sunya was created at StarkHack and received multiple awards:

- **Voyager - Voyager API Prize Pool Winner**
- **Dynamic - Pool for projects which use Dynamic Winner**
- **Herodotus - Best Use of Storage Proof API Winner**

These accolades recognize our innovative approach to smart contract security and our effective integration of multiple blockchain technologies.

## üöÄ Future Development

Our roadmap includes several exciting enhancements:

- **Enhanced Machine Learning**: Expanding our model with more diverse datasets
- **Additional Chain Support**: Extending analysis capabilities to more blockchain platforms
- **Developer Plugins**: IDE integrations for real-time security feedback
- **Automated Remediation**: Suggesting code fixes for identified vulnerabilities
- **Governance Features**: Community-driven security standards and best practices

## üåê Conclusion

Sunya represents a significant advancement in smart contract security analysis, particularly for the Starknet ecosystem. By combining intelligent vulnerability detection, seamless user experience, and transparent audit verification, we're helping developers build more secure blockchain applications while reducing the friction of security analysis.
