# Task DAO

**Task DAO** is a decentralized platform where communities can organize, assign, and reward tasks through a transparent governance system. It includes voting mechanisms, task verification, and token-based incentives.

## Key Features

- **Transparent Governance**: All decisions are made through community voting.
- **Task Verification**: Ensure tasks are completed as per requirements.
- **Token-Based Incentives**: Reward contributors with tokens for their efforts.

## Technical Implementation

The platform is built on **Ethereum**, with smart contracts handling task creation, assignment, and rewards.  
**The Graph** is used for querying blockchain data, and **IPFS** is used for storing task-related metadata.

### **Smart Contract (Solidity)**

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract TaskDAO {
    struct Task {
        uint id;
        string description;
        address assignedTo;
        uint reward;
        bool completed;
    }

    mapping(uint => Task) public tasks;
    uint public taskCount;
    address public owner;

    constructor() {
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

    function createTask(string memory description, uint reward) public {
        require(msg.sender == owner, "Only owner can create tasks");
        taskCount++;
        tasks[taskCount] = Task(taskCount, description, address(0), reward, false);
    }

    function assignTask(uint taskId, address assignee) public {
        require(tasks[taskId].id != 0, "Task does not exist");
        tasks[taskId].assignedTo = assignee;
    }

    function completeTask(uint taskId) public {
        require(tasks[taskId].assignedTo == msg.sender, "Not assigned to you");
        require(!tasks[taskId].completed, "Task already completed");
        tasks[taskId].completed = true;
        payable(msg.sender).transfer(tasks[taskId].reward);
    }
}
```
