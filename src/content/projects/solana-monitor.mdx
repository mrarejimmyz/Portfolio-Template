# Solana Transaction Monitor

This project is a real-time monitoring system for Solana blockchain transactions. It provides a dashboard that tracks and analyzes transactions on the Solana blockchain in real-time. Features include custom alerts, performance metrics, and historical data visualization.

## Key Features

- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks transactions as they occur on the Solana blockchain.
- **Custom Alerts**: Set up alerts for specific transaction types or thresholds.
- **Performance Metrics**: Analyze transaction throughput and latency.
- **Historical Data**: Visualize past transactions and trends.

## Technical Implementation

The system is built using Rust for backend processing and React for the frontend dashboard. WebSockets are used to stream real-time data to the client.

```rust
use solana_client::rpc_client::RpcClient;
use solana_sdk::pubkey::Pubkey;

fn main() {
    let client = RpcClient::new("https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com");
    let pubkey = Pubkey::from_str("YourPublicKeyHere").unwrap();

    match client.get_account(&pubkey) {
        Ok(account) => println!("Account data: {:?}", account),
        Err(err) => eprintln!("Error fetching account: {:?}", err),
    }
}
```
